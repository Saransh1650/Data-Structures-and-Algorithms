# The following solution has time complexity of o(mn) and space complexity of o(m+n) where m is the length of the first input and n is the length of the second input.

# The purpose of the solution is to find the longest common subsequence between 2 strings.
# Example â€“ 
# Input = abcd, abdf
# Output = 3 because abd is the longest subsequence (Continuation does not matter just need to be in the same sequence)
